    "\n",
    "You will use data from Kaggle's [Classication of Machine Failures](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e17) competition. The original data doesn't include economic information like the cost of repairing a machine. This information is described in this assignment and you will code it in your simulation (the original data was also synthetically generated, so it was generated with a similar process).\n",

    "You will\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function that calculates maintenance and repair costs when you use any supplied decision function for determining when to do machine maintenance\n",
    "2. Create 3 decision functions and compare their costs using the function you just wrote in step 1\n",
    "3. Write and share a Weights & Biases report so your colleagues can see the implications of using your preferred decision function. In your report, describe (in just a few sentences):\n",
    "  - How you might deal with potential covariate shift if training data was collected in winter when air temperatures are lower, so you expect future air temperatures to be warmer\n",
    "  - How you might test your decision function in reality to make sure it works before applying it at scale"
